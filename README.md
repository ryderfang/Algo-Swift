This repo is about algorithm codes writing with Swift. Two parts included.

## 🗝 Solutions

Mainly my solutions of [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) problems in Swift.

## 📦 Base

### 📔 Templetes

While solving problems I summarize those code snippets as templates. Thanks to references:

* [raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-algorithm-club)

* [SunZhiC/DataStructuresInSwift](https://github.com/SunZhiC/DataStructuresInSwift)

* LeetCode Solution Pages, such as https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/solution/

### 📚 Books

I bought several books about algorithm years ago, mostly writen by Liu Rujia (as known as [@srbga](https://www.topcoder.com/members/srbga)).

> Of course never finished reading them :(

Now I'm going to rewrite codes in these books with Swift.

Let's Go! 🖖
