### 📔 Templetes

While solving problems I summarize those code snippets as templates. Thanks to references:

### 📚 Books

I bought several books about algorithm years ago, mostly writen by Liu Rujia (as known as [@srbga](https://www.topcoder.com/members/srbga)).

> Of course never finished reading them :(

Now I'm going to rewrite codes in these books with Swift.

Let's Go! 🖖
