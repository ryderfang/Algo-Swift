# Algo-Swift

This repo is about algorithm codes writing with Swift.

I bought several books about algorithm years ago, mostly writen by Liu Rujia (as known as [@srbga](https://www.topcoder.com/members/srbga)).

> Of course never finished reading them :(

Now I'm going to rewrite codes in these books with Swift.

Let's Go! ðŸ––
